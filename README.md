## Functional specifications

- Apartments for rent can be posted/advertised by anybody 
(Fulda or non- Fulda students) with the idea that main rental 
customers are Fulda students. 
- The application allows Fulda students 
to browse, search and filter apartments for rent, and message to 
landlords. 
- People who wish to rent (Fulda or non- Fulda students) 
can post the apartment info (data, rent, images). 
- Users are able to see on Google Maps the location of an advertised apartment.
- Administrators are able to manage accounts and site content.

## Non-functional specifications

- Optimized for standard desktop/laptop browsers. It degrades 
for different sized windows, so it can be adequately rendered on 
mobile browsers. 
- Intuitive and easy to use application.
- Implemented SEO and SEM.
 

## High-level System Architecture

- Data-source. It uses MySQL relational database.
- RESTful API developed and exposed to read and write data. 
[MINI PHP](http://www.dev-metal.com/mini-extremely-simple-barebone-php-application/) Framework was used to develop the API.
- Front-end developed using AngularJS, HTML5 and CSS3.
- The application runs on an Apache web server.
